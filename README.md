Hi, I’m Fernando Estácio. I'm a Computer Science student at UERJ (Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro). 
I'm really passionate about computers, specially games, hardwares (pricing, specs and pc-building) and programming.

If I had to describe what I currently know, using 1 to 10, with 1 - 6 being the basics and 7 - 10 being more specific knowledge about the subject.

- English level: 7. 

- Logical reasoning: 6. (My logical thinking is pretty solid, in my opinion. But I still have much to learn)

- C: 4.
- C++: 5. 
- C#: 4. (Used it while learning to mess with Unity engine.)

- Python: 4.
(I think Python is a very good language, it's accessible, it's massively popular nowadays and a great starting point for the basics 
of programing and logical thinking. I just didn't get to use it much outside of my classes.)

- Java: 3.
(I would be open to learn it properly if any opportunity appears.)
